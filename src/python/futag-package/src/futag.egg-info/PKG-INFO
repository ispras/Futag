This python package is for building library, generating and compiling fuzz-drivers of functions.
* Package url: https://github.com/ispras/Futag/tree/main/src/python/futag-package
* Bug Tracker = https://github.com/ispras/Futag/issues
## 1. Install

```bash 
pip install dist/futag-2.0.3.tar.gz
```

## 2. Preprocessor
* Prerequisite: You must have [llvm-package with Futag checker](https://github.com/ispras/Futag/blob/main/README.en.md#22-build-and-install) to analyze your library.

The preprocessor module tries to configure and build your library with configure file or cmake, you should specify path to futag-llvm and path. The library then will be built with address sanitizer and Futag-checker. The class Builder of this module has 4 method:
- auto-build: automatically builds your library
- build_configure(): builds your library with configure file
- build_cmake(): builds your library with cmake
- analyze(): analyzes the result of Futag-checker. This method will generate json file futag-analysis-result.json.

Example:
```python
from futag.preprocessor import *

test_lib = Builder(
    "../../futag-llvm", #path to Futag package
    "json-c-json-c-0.13.1-20180305", #path to testing library
    #clean=True, #delete all folders generated by Futag
    #processes=8, #number of processors for building
)
test_lib.auto_build()
test_lib.analyze()
```

For more parameters of Builder please refer to docstring of this class.

## 3. Generator
The module Generator is for generating, compiling fuzz-drivers. You should specify path to analysis result (file futag-analysis-result.json), path to futag-llvm and the path to library. For more detail please refer to docstring of module.

Example:
```python
from futag.generator import * 
generator = Generator(
    "../../futag-llvm", #path to Futag package
    "json-c-json-c-0.13.1-20180305", #path to testing library
)
generator.gen_targets(anonymous=False) #generate fuzzing wrapper for private function
generator.compile_targets(16) #number of processes while compiling
```
The fuzz-drivers of libjson will be generated in futag-fuzz-drivers inside the library root.

```bash
class Generator(builtins.object)

## 4. Fuzzer

The class Fuzzer helps automatically fuzz targets. It's just a simple script for testing and may contains some unexpected bugs. 
Be careful use this function, you should test libraries in a virtual environment like Docker or VM

```python
from futag.fuzzer import *
f = Fuzzer(
    "../../futag-llvm", #path to Futag package
    "json-c-json-c-0.13.1-20180305/futag-fuzz-drivers", #path to folder, which contains all the generated fuzz-targets"
)
f.fuzz()
```

```bash
class Fuzzer(builtins.object)
 |  Fuzzer(futag_llvm_package: str, fuzz_driver_path: str = 'futag-fuzz-drivers', debug: bool = False, gdb: bool = False, svres: bool = False, fork: int = 1, totaltime: int = 300, timeout: int = 10, memlimit: int = 2048, coverage: bool = False, leak: bool = False, introspect: bool = False)
